Introduction
------------
This is an updated version of an old RSS command line application that I wrote two years ago. For no other reason but thinking that, since then, I might've learned a thing or two, I set out to update this application. Turns out I didn't had much to impart, in terms of new knowledge, to this project. Nevertheless, it is now simpler, with less modules and functionalities that I built and never used. The major changes were cosmetic, implementing code pallettes randomly to each feed. It's a fun little thing. The rest is still `Feedparser <https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ under the hood, so, no surprises there. It was a fun project updating it, even feeling that I didn't do much, sometimes it's the little things.
